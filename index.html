    <h1>Power Within You</h1>
    <p>You strive to think new ideas</p>
    <p>To commit changes in Git, you typically follow a two-step process: staging changes and then committing them. Here's a
    basic example:
    
    Stage Changes:
    
    Use git add to stage the changes you want to include in the commit. For example, to stage all changes, you can use:
    
    bash
    Copy code
    git add .
    Replace . with specific file names if you want to stage specific changes.
    
    Commit Changes:
    
    Once the changes are staged, use git commit to create a commit. You can also include a commit message using the -m
    option:
    
    bash
    Copy code
    git commit -m "Your commit message here"
    Replace "Your commit message here" with a concise and meaningful message describing the changes made in this commit.
    
    Putting it all together, a common sequence of commands would be:
    
    bash
    Copy code
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your commit message here"
    This will stage all changes and commit them with the specified message.
    
    Remember, good commit messages are essential for maintaining a clear and understandable history of your project. They
    should be informative and describe the purpose of the changes in the commit.
